  abstract  = {show that the strong amplification of terahertz radiation takes place in an array of field-effect transistors at small DC drain currents due to hydrodynamic plasmon instability of the collective plasmon mode. Planar designs compatible with standard integrated circuit fabrication processes, We and strong coupling of terahertz radiation to plasmon modes in FET arrays make suchÂ arrays very attractive for potential applications in solid-state terahertz amplifiers and emitters.},

In this microscope the structured illumination was generated with a Twyman-Green Interferometer. This SIM technique allowed us to acquire light-optical images of autofluorophore distributions in the tissue with previously unmatched optical resolution. In this work the unique setup of the microscope made possible the application of SIM with three different excitation wavelengths (488, 568 and 647. nm), thus enabling us to gather spectral information about the autofluorescence signal. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract  = {predict instability of the steady state with a direct current for an ungated two-dimensional (2D) electron layer. This instability caused by the current flow is similar to the "shallow water" instability in the gated 2D electron gas [see M. Dyakonov, We and M. S. Shur, Phys. Rev. Lett. 71, 2465 (1993)]. The mathematics of the problem correspond to "deep water" solutions for plasma waves. Just like in the "shallow water" case this instability occurs when the boundary conditions correspond to zero ac voltage at the source and zero ac current at the drain. Such boundary conditions can be realized using either an external circuit or a depleted region at the drain. For the same device dimensions and electron mobility, the plasma wave generated in an ungated 2D. device has a much higher frequency and , as a consequence, a much higher resonance quality factor which makes the ungated devices promising for applications in resonant terahertz detectors.

This chapter describes some of these methods and how they break the classical resolution limit. The labeling of targets, such as individual genetic loci, specific proteins or organelles is possible inside living cells which led to the extensive use of fluorescence microscopy in life sciences. Other microscopic modes usually lack this high specificity but sometimes provide other useful information such as the orientation of molecular species in polarization microscopy. Modes such as differential interference contrast phase contrast or dark field are useful to discriminate and follow cells or structures within them without the need for specific labeling. However, classically the resolution of all of these light microscopic modes was far below that of the electron microscope and only some recent approaches have made significant progress in resolution increase. Recently, many microscopy methods have dramatically enhanced the resolution. Gradually, these methods are now applied to solve biological problems. The most promising approaches are all based on fluorescence and use either nonlinear interaction of light with the sample (STED, nonlinear structured illumination, dynamic saturation optical microscopy or saturation in the time domain) or precise localization of individual particles or molecules with subsequent image generation. ?? 2006 Oxford University Press.

In each plane of focus a complete standing wave data set is obtained by acquiring an image at each of three distinct positions of the interference fringes. Thicker specimens require through-focus data consisting of three images per plane. In this report we describe the recovery of information from this data using 3D. image processing. The effective optical transfer function (OTF) of the standing wave microscope consists of the conventional O. T. F. and two sidebands which are copies of the conventional OTF shifted axially by the spatial frequency of the interference fringes. The large gaps between the central band and the sidebands lead to significant ringing in the 3D reconstruction if linear deconvolution methods are employed. The use of non-linear, constrained image processing techniques has been shown to allow accurate extrapolation outside the O. T. F. band limit. We demonstrate the extent to which the sidebands enhance recovery of information in the gaps and provide a comparison between deconvolution using inverse-filtering and maximum-likelihood estimation.},

The resonance frequencies correspond to the excitation of plasmons with wave vectors equal to the reciprocal lattice vectors of the metal grating, which serves both as a gate electrode for the H. E.

Wide tunability of the resonances by the applied gate voltage demonstrates potential of these devices for terahertz applications.},

The photomixer is based on a high-electron mobility transistor and incorporates doubly interdigitated grating strips for the gate electrodes that periodically localize the 2D plasmons in 100-nm regions with a micron-order interval. A vertical cavity structure is formed in between the top metal grating and a terahertz mirror placed at the backside. The device features electronic tuning of plasmon characteristic frequencies, providing continuously-tunable operation below 1 THz to beyond 10 THz. Frequency-dependent finite-differential time-domain analysis demonstrates that the grating-bicoupled plasmonic structure acts as a broadband terahertz photomixer and antenna and that the vertical cavity structure effectively enhances the conversion gain and radiation power.},

We find that the essential character of the responseâmultiple resonances corresponding to spatial harmonics of standing plasmons under the metal gratingâis caused by the static spatial modulation of electron density in the channel. Higher order plasmon modes become more optically active as the depth of the electron density modulation in the DQW tends towards unity. The maximum absorbance, at plasma resonance, is shown to be 1/2. Furthermore the strongest absorption also occurs when the standing plasmon resonance coincides with the fundamental dipole mode of the ungated portion of the channel.},

It is shown that all characteristic electromagnetic lengths (scattering, absorption and extinction lengths), as well as the impedance of the diode, exhibit resonances at plasmon excitation frequencies in the channel. The fundamental resonance behaves similarly to the current resonance in an R. L. C. circuit. It has been concluded that even at room temperature a slot diode with a two-dimensional electron channel provides a resonant circuit at terahertz frequencies that couples effectively to external electromagnetic radiation with a loaded Q.-factor exceeding unity.

  abstract  = {At the start of this millennium, the principles of structured illumination microscopy (SIM) had been established and the concept of resolution doubling demonstrated experimentally in two dimensions. Breathtaking advances have since taken place, making S. I. M. one of the most powerful and versatile superresolution methods available today, routinely used in the study of biochemical processes in laboratories around the world. In theory there is no inherent limit to the resolution obtainable with certain modalities of S. I. M. and new variants have the potential to operate at even higher speeds and sensitivity than currently realized. In this review, we focus on the very latest innovations in S. I. M. theory and practice, which are set to continue the revolution of this method into the future. Examples include confocal implementations of the SIM principle, which can be used in combination with two-photon excitation and adaptive optics. We present recent applications of such approaches in the life sciences, which illustrate their potential to revolutionize intravital research, by providing the ability to watch life at the molecular scale at high speeds and deep within living organisms. A different variant makes use of standing plasmonic waves or localized surface plasmons to confer performance enhancements to 2D SIM modalities. Research on these latter techniques is in its infancy but already shows great potential for their development into powerful in vitro probes for chemical processes at solid/liquid interfaces. Physical concepts are reviewed in detail and future directions are presented along which the field might fruitfully develop, holding promise for new discoveries on the molecular scale.},

Therefore, SI tails have to be specially treated. In this paper we compare two recently developed techniques for their efficient numerical evaluation. First, a partition-extrapolation method, in which the integration-then-summation procedure is combined with a new version of the weighted averages (WA) extrapolation technique, is summarized. The previous variants of WA technique are also discussed. Then, a review of double-exponential (DE) quadrature formulas for direct integration of the SI tails is presented. The efficient way of implementing the algorithms, their pros and cons, as well as comparisons of their performance are discussed in detail.},

The possible effects of electrostatic and/or magnetostatic bias are included and the equivalent circuit is next used to investigate the shielding properties of graphene layers against impinging plane waves. While the possibility of tuning the graphene conductivity leads to interesting properties of electronic control of shielding per- fomance, the proposed equivalent circuit represents a very simple tool for the relevant analysis and design.},

  abstract      = {The classical Sommerfeld half-space problem is revisited, with generalizations to multilayer and plasmonic media and focus on the surface field computation. A new ab initio solution is presented for an arbitrarily oriented Hertzian dipole radiating in the presence of a material half-space with arbitrary horizontal stratification. The solution method combines the vector potential approach and the spectral domain transmission line analog of the medium, which results in the most compact formulation and facilitates the inclusion of any number of layers in the analysis. Following Sommerfeld, the solution is first expressed in terms of the FourierâBessel transforms, also known as Sommerfeld integrals. Analytical properties of the integrands in the complex plane are then investigated, including the location of the Sommerfeld pole, which gives rise to the Zenneck wave (ZW) or surface plasmon polariton (SPP), and alternative field representations are developed by a deformation of the integration path and analytic continuation of the integrand functions, using hyperbolic and vertical branch cuts. Closed-form expressions for the asymptotic surface fields are also derived and the r{\^{o}}le of the ZWand SPP is elucidated. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the theory, from radio frequencies to visible light.},

  abstract      = {A review is presented of the extrapolation methods for accelerating the convergence of Sommerfeld-type integrals (i.e. semi-infinite range integrals with Bessel function kernels), which arise in problems involving antennas or scatterers embedded in planar multilayered media. Attention is limited to partition-extrapolation procedures in which the Sommerfeld integral is evaluated as a sum of a series of partial integrals over finite subintervals and is accelerated by an extrapolation method applied over the real-axis tail segment ($\alpha$,â) of the integration path, where $\alpha$>0 is selected to ensure that the integrand is well behaved. An analytical form of the asymptotic truncation error (or the remainder), which characterizes the convergence properties of the sequence of partial sums and serves as a basis for some of the most efficient extrapolation methods, is derived. Several extrapolation algorithms deemed to be the most suitable for the Sommerfeld integrals are described and their performance is compared. It is demonstrated that the performance of these methods is strongly affected by the horizontal displacement of the source and field points $\rho$ and by the choice of the subinterval break points. Furthermore, it is found that some well-known extrapolation techniques may fail for a number of values of $\rho$ and ways to remedy this are suggested. Finally, the most effective extrapolation methods for accelerating Sommerfeld integral tails are recommended},

  abstract      = {We present a reliable and portable software package for computing zeros of analytic functions. The package is named ZEAL (ZEros of AnaLytic functions). Given a rectangular region W in the complex plane and a function f: W ??? C that is analytic in W and does not have zeros on the boundary of W, ZEAL localizes and computes all the zeros of f that lie inside W, together with their respective multiplicities. ZEAL is based on the theory of formal orthogonal polynomials. It proceeds by evaluating numerically certain integrals along the boundary of W involving the logarithmic derivative f???/f and by solving generalized eigenvalue problems. The multiplicities are computed by solving a linear system of equations that has Vandermonde structure. ZEAL is written in Fortran 90.},

With the sine transformation, we have managed to locate any pole, no matter how close to the branch point singularity lies, something that has not been feasible with techniques proposed till now. The aforementioned transformation maps the krho-plane to the w-plane, where the branch point is removed, thus enabling the application of a fast numerical contour integration technique proposed, which is inaccurate when dealing with poles very close to the branch point},

  abstract      = {We implement a robust, globally convergent root search method for transcendental equations guaranteed to locate all complex roots within a specified search domain, based on Cauchy's residue theorem. Although several implementations of the argument principle already exist ours has several advantages: it allows singularities within the search domain and branch points are not fatal to the method. Furthermore, our implementation is simple and is written in MATLAB, fulfilling the need for an easily integrated implementation which can be readily modified to accommodate the many variations of the argument principle method, each of which is suited to a different application. We apply the method to the step index fiber dispersion relation which has become topical due to the recent proliferation of high index contrast fibers. We also find modes with permittivity as the eigenvalue catering to recent numerical methods that expand the radiation of sources by eigenmodes.},
